    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Queen's Gambit follows the life of an orphan chess prodigy, Beth Harmon, during her quest to become the
        world's greatest chess player while struggling with emotional problems and drug and alcohol dependency. The
        series' title refers to a chess opening of the same name. The story begins in the mid-1950s and proceeds into
        the 1960s.

        <br>
        The story begins in Lexington, Kentucky, where a nine-year-old Beth, having lost her mother in a car crash, is
        taken to an orphanage where she is taught chess by the building's custodian, Mr. Shaibel. As was common during
        the 1950s, the orphanage dispenses daily tranquilizer pills to the girls, which turns into an addiction
        for Beth. She quickly becomes a strong chess player due to her visualization skills, which are enhanced by the
        tranquilizers. A few years later, Beth is adopted by Alma Wheatley and her husband from Lexington. As she
        adjusts to her new home, Beth enters a chess tournament and wins despite having no prior experience in
        competitive chess. She develops friendships with several people, including former Kentucky state champion Harry
        Beltik; gifted but arrogant chess prodigy Benny Watts and journalist, photographer and fellow player D.L.
        Townes. As Beth continues to win games and reaps the financial benefits of her success, she becomes more
        dependent on alcohol and other drugs.

        titles or are otherwise renowned.</p>
    <h2>History of women in chess</h2>
    <p>
        From the Middle Ages through the 18<sup>th</sup> century, chess was a popular social pastime for both men and
        women of the
        upper classes. The earliest recorded woman chess player is the 13<sup>th</sup> century Sicilian baroness Macalda
        di
        Scaletta. Mary, Queen of Scots, and Queen Elizabeth I played, and Thomas Jefferson wrote several times about
        Benjamin Franklin's playing chess in Paris with socially important women, including the Duchess of Bourbon
        Bathilde d'Orléans, who was "a chess player of about his force". Chess games between men and women were a
        common theme of European art and literature in the fourteenth through 18<sup>th</sup> centuries.

        By the 19<sup>th</sup> century, however, the chess world had become dominated by male chess players. During the
        20<sup>th</sup>
        century, female players made significant progress in breaking male dominance on the game, and a few female
        players (such as Vera Menchik) could compete successfully with men. Menchik also won the first Women's World
        Chess Championship in 1927.

        In 1950 Lyudmila Rudenko became the first female International Master.

        In 1976 Rohini Khadilkar became the first female to compete in the Indian Men's Championship. Her involvement in
        a male competition caused a furore that necessitated a successful appeal to the High Court and caused the World
        Chess Federation president, Max Euwe, to rule that women cannot be barred from national and international
        championships.

        In 1978 Nona Gaprindashvili became the first female Grandmaster.

        Judit Polgár is the only female player to have defeated the reigning world number one in a game, which occurred
        when she beat Garry Kasparov in 2002. She was also the only female player to play for a small-scale
        World Chess Championship, which she did in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005; she had previously
        participated in large, 100+ player knockout tournaments for the world championship, but this was a small
        8-player invitational. More recently, Hou Yifan has been the leading female player, winning the Biel GM
        tournament in 2017.
