<h2> "Our first movie": THE READER (2008)</h2>
<p>The Reader is a 2008 romantic drama film directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, based on the
    1995 German novel of the same name by Bernhard Schlink. It stars Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and David
    Kross. It was the last film for producers Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack, both of whom died prior to
    its release. Production began in Germany in September 2007, and the film opened in limited release on
    December 10, 2008.

    The film tells the story of Michael Berg, a German lawyer who, as a 15-year-old in 1958, has a sexual
    relationship with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz. She disappears only to resurface years later as one of the
    defendants in a war crimes trial stemming from her actions as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. Michael
    realizes that Hanna is keeping a personal secret she believes is worse than her Nazi past – a secret which,
    if revealed, could help her at the trial.

    Although it received mixed reviews, Winslet and Kross, who plays the young Michael, received acclaim for
    their performances; Winslet won a number of awards for her role, including the Academy Award for Best
    Actress. The film itself was nominated for several other major awards, including the Academy Award for Best
    Picture. </p>
<p>In 1995 Berlin, after a woman he has spent the night with leaves his apartment abruptly after he has made
    her breakfast, Michael Berg watches a U-Bahn pass by, setting up a flashback to a tram in 1958. In the
    flashback, as a 15-year-old boy, Michael (David Kross) feels sick while wandering the streets. Pausing
    nearby an apartment building he vomits. Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a tram conductor returning home,
    cleans him up and helps him return home. Michael, diagnosed with scarlet fever, recuperates at home for
    three months, and once recovered, he visits Hanna with flowers to thank her.

    The 36-year-old Hanna seduces him, and they begin an affair. They spend much of their time together having
    sex in her apartment after she has had Michael read to her from literary works he is studying. After a
    bicycling trip with Michael, Hanna learns that she was promoted to a clerical job at the tram company's
    office, upon which she suddenly leaves her home, without telling Michael or anyone else where she has moved
    to. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_(2008_film)" target="_blank"><em>Read more about this

<p>Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American teen drama film written by Tom Schulman, directed by Peter Weir, and
    starring Robin Williams. Set in 1959 at the fictional elite conservative Vermont boarding school Welton
    Academy,[4] it tells the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of
    poetry.

    The film was a commercial success and received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for
    Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Actor for Robin Williams. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best
    Film,[5] the César Award for Best Foreign Film and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Film.
    Schulman received an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his work.<br>
    n the autumn of 1959, Todd Anderson begins his senior year of high school at Welton Academy, an all-male,
    elite prep school. He is assigned one of Welton's most promising students, Neil Perry, as his roommate and
    meets Neil's friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Stephen Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton.

    On the first day of classes, they are surprised by the unorthodox teaching methods of the new English
    teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus himself, he encourages his students to "make your lives
    extraordinary", a sentiment he summarizes with the Latin expression carpe diem, meaning "seize the day."

    Subsequent lessons include having them take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life
    in a different way, telling them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books which explains a
    mathematical formula used for rating poetry, and inviting them to make up their own style of walking in a
    courtyard to encourage them to be individuals. His methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale
    Nolan.

    Upon learning that Keating was a member of the unsanctioned Dead Poets Society while he was at Welton, Neil
    restarts the club and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave where they read poetry and verse,
    including their own compositions. As the school year progresses, Keating's lessons and their involvement
    with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, an attractive
    cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school whose family is
    friends with his.

    Neil discovers his love of acting and gets the role as Puck in a local production of A Midsummer Night's
    Dream, despite the fact that his domineering father Thomas wants him in the Ivy League (and ultimately
    medical school). Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him
    through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his composing a poem spontaneously in front of the
    class.

    However, Charlie takes things too far when he publishes an article in the school newspaper in the club's
    name demanding that girls be admitted to Welton. Nolan paddles Charlie to coerce him into revealing who else
    is in the Dead Poets Society, but he resists. Nolan also speaks with Keating, warning him that he should
    discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating does admonish the boys (in his manner), warning
    that one must assess all consequences.

    Thomas discovers Neil's involvement in the play and forces him to quit on the eve of the opening
    performance. Devastated, Neil goes to Keating, who advises him to stand his ground and prove to Thomas that
    his love of acting is something he takes seriously. Thomas unexpectedly shows up at the performance. He
    takes Neil home and says he has been withdrawn from Welton, only to be enrolled in a military academy to
    prepare him for Harvard so he will become a doctor. Unable to find the courage to stand up to his father,
    and lacking any support from his concerned mother, a distraught Neil commits suicide.

    Nolan investigates Neil's death at the request of the Perry family. Cameron blames Neil's death on Keating
    to escape punishment for his own participation in the Dead Poets Society, and names the other members.
    Confronted by Charlie, Cameron urges the rest of them to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron
    and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's office to sign a letter attesting to the truth of
    Cameron's allegations, even though they know they are false. When Todd's turn comes, he is reluctant to
    sign, but does so after seeing that the others have complied and succumbing to his parents' pressure.

    Keating is fired and Nolan (who taught English at Welton before becoming headmaster) takes over teaching the
    class, with the intent of adhering to traditional Welton rules. Keating interrupts the class to gather his
    leftover belongings. As he leaves, Todd stands up on his desk and says "O Captain! My Captain!", which
    prompts the other members of the Dead Poets Society (except for Cameron) to do the same, to Nolan's fury and
    Keating's pleased surprise. Touched by this gesture, Keating proudly thanks the boys and departs.<br>
